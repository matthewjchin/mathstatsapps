The probability that the random variable takes values in any interval $\\left[a,b\\right]$ in $\\left[0,1\\right]$ is then the area under the function $f(x)$ on $\\left[a,b\\right]$. If $f(x)$ were not a constant function, say the numbers near 1 are more likely to occur than those near 0, then the function would take larger values near 1 than near 0. The total area under $f(x)$ must be 1 to reflect the idea that the total probability over all possible values of the random variable must be 1.

    "First, how many possible outcomes are there when you flip a coin 10 times? Well, on any flip there are two possible outcomes, $H$ or $T$. We can think of this as a fork in universe of all possible roads leading us to an outcome. If $H$, bear left and if $T$ bear right. Once the coin lands, we take that fork. If the coin landed $H$, and went left, then we are standing at $H$ when we flip again. That will give us another fork in the road, and so on. Each fork has two options and there are 10 forks, so there are $2^{10}$ (or 1024) possible outcomes. This is an example of the **multiplication principle**. If there are $m$ ways to perform task $A$ and $n$ ways to perform task $B$, then there are $mn$ ways to perform task $A$ followed by task $B$. If there are three meat toppings and 10 veggie topings at a pizza place, there are 30 possible pizzas with one meat and one veggie topping. "

Indeed, we can write out the sample space of four possible outcomes and use the conditional probability formula to verify that our intuition is correct.

    "Many random variables have a symmetric, bell-shaped distribution with more values in the middle than at the extremes on either side. If you look at heights of adult men in the United States, for example, most men are close to average height, and the number of men who are very short or very tall is fairly small. In fact, you've probably heard of the normal distribution which is often used to model such variables. The normal distribution has a symmetric, bell-shaped pdf, centered at an average value  𝜇  and with standard deviation  𝜎  which determines how spread out the distribution is around  𝜇. The distribution is copletely determined by $\\mu$ and $\\sigma$, and we often abbreviate by writing $X \\sim N(\\mu,\\sigma)$."

This is a big assumption. We are saying that each person in the underlying population of men/women had an equally likely chance of appearing in our samples. This is almost certainly not true. On the other hand, if we have no reason to believe that there's systematic bias in the sampling procedure, we might expect that our sample is close enough to random so as to be representative of the respective underlying populations. Of course, if we picked all 65 men from the same rural town in Sweden, and all 65 women from an elite group of marathon runners, it would clearly be the case that our samples are not representative of the underlying populations.

Making an inference about a huge population from such a small sample of individuals seems like a daunting task."

In general, how big the sample size needs to be depends on the population distribution. In fact, if the underlying population is normal then the sampling distribution is normal for any sample size. If the underlying distribution is not normal, but is roughly mound shaped and symmetric, then the approximation will be reasonable for smaller sample sizes. If you know nothing about the underlying distribution, $n=30$ is a good rule of thumb for the sampling distribution to be approximately normal."
